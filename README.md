**F1 Reaction Time Game with Ghosts**

In this game, players are presented with a countdown timer, much like the starting lights at an F1 race. The goal is to react as quickly as possible when the lights go out.

Instead of typical racing lights, my game uses ghost characters to add an entertaining element. The small ghosts blink like the lights and players must hit the spacebar as soon as the big ghosts reveal itself. The reaction time is recorded, and users can track their best time. If the players hit Spacebar the second time the game resets and starts again.
